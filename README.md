## InlineEmailImagesAspNetCoreThis demonstrates to send the inline images in Asp.NetCoreMany a times you may face an issue of sending an image within an email. You might go up with these options such as:- uploading the documents to the server and then attaching the links to it.- converting the attachment to the base64 and then attaching to the email.To overcome this you can use instead **AlternateView** and **LinkedResource** class.>LinkedResource can be defined as:```var inlineLogo = new LinkedResource(logo, "image/png"){	ContentId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),	TransferEncoding = TransferEncoding.Base64};```>AlternateView can be created as:```var view = AlternateView.CreateAlternateViewFromString(body, null, "text/html");```> After that, we need to add the linked resources in the view, we can do this by:```view.LinkedResources.Add(inlineLogo);```> And also you need to add alternate view to your **MailMessage** object, as this:```> newMail.AlternateViews.Add(view);```Horraaay! Inline images in email has been successfully configured without the **.bin** attachment.>Comment down for concerns if any.
